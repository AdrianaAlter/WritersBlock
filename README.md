<a href="https://writersblockapp.herokuapp.com/">Writer's Block</a> is a single-page productivity app with a Ruby on Rails backend and a React.js frontend.  It rewards you for working on writing projects; you earn one point for every ten words you add to the word count.

You can use your points to buy customizations--including backgrounds, fonts, and text colors--for the interface.
